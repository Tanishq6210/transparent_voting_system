##  Overview of the Project

>An app that will check your body posture while you are doing an exercise and show how accurate the posture is.

## Inspiration
> Nearly 32.6% of the injuries that happen during workouts and training happen due to incorrect posture. 
>We often neglect the possibility of having a personal coach with ourselves, especially during the lockdown season.
> Our team has the perfect solution to rectify wrong postures during work outs.

## What it does

###  Significance of the Project

* Helps track your posture for different exercises.

* Trained the ML model with verified postures for the exercises provided.

* User Friendly User Interface.


###  Objectives we want to achieve

* We want our app to help people avoid common injuries caused during their exercise.

* The app will also alert the user if there is a gross error in the posture

## How we built it

###  Project Timeline

Phase 01 :
We started the out with our problem statement and then carried on an ideation train. Discovered a novelty point. Decided on all the features the application can have.

Phase 02 :
Structured out the framework of the app and made the design for the app in figma. 

Phase 03 :
Trained the ML model using verified postures for the given exercises.

Phase 04 :
Integrating all the work packages and finalizing it. 
Deploying the app. 

## Challenges we ran into

>There were several challenges that we faced during the making of an app of this scale.
>> The first one was the machine learning model that we had to implement, of all the models available we settled for TensorFlow because of its high performance in CPU mode only.
>> The second challenge was the type of metric that we were going to implement. We decided to go with RMSE due to its low variance and bias.
>> There were several other minor challenges that we faced including the design of our app, but as a team we were able to debug each and every problem

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

*We as a team are proud that we were able to tackle and accomplish the given task assigned in time and also were able to add several other features into the app. 

*We have been able to successfully able to precisely predict the a model's accuracy in real time.

*Being college freshers, it's been a humongous task to put together a full stack application in stipulated period of time. 

## What we learned

The things we learnt and achieved as a team:
<ul>
<li>Team management - Working together as a team</li>
<li>Time management - Delivering the goals in a limited amount of time</li>
<li>Full Stack Integration - Integrated different technologies together by working together</li>
<li>Importance of "Team"</li>
</ul>

## What's next for GymBud

We believe that our app GymBud has limitless levels of expansion
Future feature implementation includes using sensor to collect data from smart  watches
We would also like to use one on one
